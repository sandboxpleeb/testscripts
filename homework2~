# assignment: 1.) create a directory in the home directory called '.camp' if it does not exist.
# 2.) if no files are present in the directory create one called '00_first.sh' and one called '99_last.sh'.
# 3.) source each of the scripts in the directory in order into the current shell.
# 4.) report that this has been done.
#
# change to home directory & make ~/.camp directory only if successfully changed to root and no ~/.camp exists; while that is happening, report any errors to errorlog.
#
# change to  ~/.camp
#
# create 2 files: 01_first.sh & 99_last.sh
#
# try lessfile if echo > doesn't work.
# attempting to suppress error, "" by using > stdout || ./ stderr to errolog.
